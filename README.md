# CS300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I was creating a program that would read data from a file and store it in a data structure.  This data was for a university advising office to help them
in organize and accessing course information for students.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem with two main factors in mind.  The first is what features did they want the program to be capable of, and the second was by doing runtime analysis of three different data structures.  In the end I decided on a binary search tree.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I ran into a few roadblocks along the activites, I used my textbook and coding forums like stack overflow for answers when I was stumped.  I used trial and error with critical thinking to find the best way to simplify my code.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I knew about data structures but did not really understand the complexity or vastness of possibilities.  This course has helped in terms of thinking more in terms of algorithms as well as teaching me how to use Big-O notation and do a runtime analysis.  These skills I am positive will impact my future as a software engineer.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I was already very focused on readability of code as well as using comments properly, however this course increased my focus on those.  Another benefit I gained while progressing this course was working more on the modularity of my code so that it is more adaptable and easier to change.  By learning more about structures and databases I believe I will be writing much more professional code from now on out.
